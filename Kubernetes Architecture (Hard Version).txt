4. What is the role of etcd?

	a. creates containers on worker nodes
	b. provides API for attaching to the pods
	c. stores cluster data in the form of key-value pairs
	d. works as an agent between worker node and control plane

5. What is the role of kube-apiserver?

	a. creates deployments from YAML manifests.
	b. exposes endpoints which helps in communication between components and user.
	c. helps in creating Java APIs
	d. used to install kubelet

6. Which of these is not handled by control plane?

	a. scheduling pods on worker nodes
	b. maintaining configuration data for the cluster.
	c. On demand, application scaling
	d. configuration management for physical servers which run kubernetes

7. What is Kubernetes Object?

	a. entities containing configuration related data about virtual machines
	b. blueprint for creating containers
	c. persistent entities which describe the desired state of the cluster
	d. Java objects used for creating applications

8. What can be used to manipulate kubernetes objects handled by a kubernetes system?

	a. Kubenetes API
	b. Java Libraries
	c. Python packages
	d. Kube proxy

9. What is a Controller in Kubernetes?

	a. a component which maintains control related data of clusters.
	b. a component which watches and regulates the object states in a cluster.
	c. a component responsible for controlling scheduling based tasks.
	d. control plane is also known as controller

10. What is the job of kube-controller-manager?

	a. manages all the controllers defined for a cluster.
	b. maintains all the master nodes in a cluster.
	c. exposes functions for creating pods in a deployment.
	d. exposes functions to create services in a deployments.

11. What does the cloud-controller-manager do?

	a. maintains controller related to cloud providers.
	b. maintains cloud providers for a cluster.
	c. creates a configuration for cloud based services
	d. selects controls for cloud provider

12. What is kubelet?

	a. used for persisting container data out of the cluster.
	b. manages network related task for a worker node
	c. daemon used by API server to communicate with worker node
	b. helps in creating kubernetes cluster.

13. What does kube-proxy handle? (select any number of choices)

	a. maintains networking nodes
	b. configures network between pods
	c. enables communication between services and pods.
	d. assists in port forwarding from services to pods

14. What is the role of container runtime? (select any two)

	a. reponsible for providing an environment for container execution.
	b. facilitates containerization at the lowest level.
	c. configures container network
	d. command used for creating container images

15. Does the controller directly communicate with the kubelet?

	a. Yes
	b. No

16. What is the role of kube-scheduler?

	a. executes commands on pod containers
	b. used to handle I/O in API Server
	c. creates scheduling algorithms for kubernetes
	d. finds and binds a pod to a suitable node

17. Which of these handle network configuration for the pod inter-communication?

	a. Host
	b. Control Plane
	c. cni-plugin
	d. kube-proxy

18. What is a CRI?

	a. Container Runtime used for creating containers
	b. A specification for container runtimes for integration with kubelet
	c. kubelet sub-process which manages multiple container runtimes on a single node.
	d. initializes kubelet on worker nodes

19. Where does the kubelet runs?

	a. Worker node
	b. Control Plane
	c. Both a and b
	d. None of the above
