#### Assignment 1:

- Create a variable with a variable name `h1` and assign it a value of 200

- Create another variable, give it a name, `h2`, assign it a value 3.

- Write python statements for the following outputs:


```
The variable h1 has a value of 200
The variable h2 has a value of 1
```

> Remember not to use number literals for printing 200 and 3, you need to print the value of the variables, h1 & h2.

- After that, create a third variable and assign it a value of sum of `h1` and `h2`. Name this variable `h3`.

- Now, print all of these variable one after the other in a single line.

  - Expected Output :
    
    200 3 203

- Try creating a new variable with a name `1abc`. If you get an error. Then, identify the issue with this and fix it.


- Create a new variable, name it `var1`.

> Remember the variable var1 should not store any value.
> Hint: We studied about a datatype which can be used to create this kind of a variable, use it.


- Create two new variables with one containing your name and one containing one of your friends name.

- Use the above two variables to print the following statement as output.

Expected Output:

`<Your-friends-name> is a friend of <Your-name>`

- Modify the above command in such a way that it uses "---" in place of " " as a separator.

Expected Output:

`<Your-friends-name>---is a friend of---<Your-name>`

- Create two new variables, such that one contains "Hello " and the other contains "World". After that create a third variable which contains the following string:

`Hello World`

> Remember you do not have to assign "Hello World" string to the third variable but use the two previously created variables to create the third one.
