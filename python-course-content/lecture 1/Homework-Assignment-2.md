### Assignment 2

- Identify the Datatype of the following:

  "This is an example"
  10
  2.3
  \[1,24,2,5,2,2\]
  \{ 23 : "Hello", 4 : "New", 7 : "Eleven", 34 : 45 \}
  None
  True
  False
  "True"
  'None'


- Create a variable `var0` and assign it a value 72. Now, Create another variable `var1` and assign it the value of `var0` multiplied by 2. After that print the values of both the variable on the screen.

> NOTE: Remember, Do not assign the var1 the value 72 multiplied by 2 directly.

- Open script mode on your terminal and try adding "19" and 5. This will result in an error. Analyse the error message and then try to identify the issue in it.

- Create two new variables, "x" and "y" and assign them values 45 and 26 respectively. Once done, Print the values of these variables in the following format:

  - Expected Output:
    
    `The value of x is <value-of-x>`
    `The value of y is <value-of-y>`

  After that update the value of the variable `x` by assigning it the value of `y` squared or in other words `y` multiplied by `y`. Once done, print the value of `x` again, in the same format as mentioned above.


### Bonus Question:

- What would be the output of the following statement? Explain why we got the given output?

  `print(print("Hello World"),print("Hello Stranger"))`
