### Assignment 1

1. Write a python program which calculates the result of these expression:

  - 234 x 23 + 3
  - (542 + 442) * 2343
  - (432^3 + 323)*3446
  - 242+342*352

2. Explain the precedence of operators and how can we use it create expressions.

3. Explain the order in which the operations in the given expression will be made to evaluate the final result:

  - 342*52+5/2+22
  - 100**2/2 + 1/2
  - 234/3%2+1
  - 

4. Write a python statement which check if number stored variable `a` is less than number stored in variable `b`.

5. List all the relational operators which can be used in python.

6. What is `eval()` function used for?

7. Use `eval()` function to evaluate the following expressions:

  - 994+3235*522
  - 925590*352
  - 352**2 + 342
  - 422%1+52

9. Examine the error given by the following programs and rectify the mistakes made.

  - eval("4+")
  - eval("352+3/")
  - 3/0
  
10. What would be the final value of `var` after the following commands are executed:

```
b = 100
b += 1352
b-2
b *= 22
```

11. Which one of these is a correct statement about the short-hand assignment statement:

  - Short-hand assignment statement are used to assign None value to a variable
  - a += b is equivalent to a = a + b
  - Short-hand assignment statements is used to assign the value on the right of the operator to the variable on the left side
  - Short-hand assignment operators are used calculate the square root of a value and print it on the console.

12. Write a python program which takes `x` and `y` as an input from the users, evaluates the following expressions and prints the output of the expressions in the following format.

Expressions: 
  x\*y+y\*3
